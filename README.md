# Civ6Mod-OPUS-Echo-of-Starsong
A Civilization Mod for OPUS:Echo of Starsong

## Known Issues:
- Missing Building Model(Unique Building BUILDING_LUMEN_TRANSMUTATION_ENGINES and BUILDING_LUMEN_ALTAR. It is caused by somthing wrong with the artdef file `Buildings`, and maybe the building states or building chains. I tried and wasted many days but in vain.)
- Unit Ability Bugs(Unique Unit `UNIT_KAY_VOLAN`. He's promotion `PROMOTION_KAY_VOLAN_RIGHT2` should enable him to move after attacking.)
